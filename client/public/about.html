                  <h3>Chelsea Sanders</h3>
                  <p>I am a web developer and proud student at WOZ U. Prior to starting a career in software development, I
                    have enjoyed over two decades in both the performing and visual arts. From being a classically trained
                    Ballet dancer to acting and modelling. In these latter years I have focused my time toward training talented
                    youth as a loving and dedicated dance teacher. When I'm not working I devote my time to serving church
                    missions, interning with the mayor of North Las Vegas and working in collaboration with Faraday Future,
                    or I can be found trying new recipes I found on Pinterest. I live my life by a simple motto, "I came,
                    I saw, I made it awkward.".</p>
